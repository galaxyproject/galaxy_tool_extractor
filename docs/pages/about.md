Galaxy Communities Dock, aka **Galaxy Codex**, is a catalog of Galaxy resources (i.e. tools, training, workflows) that can be filtered for any community.

The [repository located here](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy_codex) stores the source for building this catalog. The catalog is automatically updated every week.

Any Galaxy community can be added to this project and benefit from the dedicated resources, including interactive tables that can be embedded into subdomains and websites.
